Smart Traffic Control System

The system uses two pre-processed videos with cars approaching an intersection. Video1 is considered as lane1 and Video2 is considered as lane2.
A pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for car detection is then used to detect cars in Lane1(Video1) and Lane2(Video2) and a comparison is made and the lane with the most vehicles is given a green light priority.
The system also detects Red light Violators and Stolen Vehicles.
